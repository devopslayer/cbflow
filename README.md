## üß† Overview

This is a simple **Chatbot Flow Builder** built using **React** and **React Flow**. It allows users to visually create chatbot flows by connecting different message nodes.

> A chatbot flow is constructed by connecting multiple message nodes, determining their execution order via drag-and-drop and edge connections.
